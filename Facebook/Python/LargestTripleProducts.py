"""
You're given a list of n integers arr[0..(n-1)]. You must compute a list output[0..(n-1)] such that, for each index i (between 0 and n-1, inclusive), 
output[i] is equal to the product of the three largest elements out of arr[0..i] (or equal to -1 if i < 2, as arr[0..i] then includes fewer than three elements).
Note that the three largest elements used to form any product may have the same values as one another, but they must be at different indices in arr.
Signature
int[] findMaxProduct(int[] arr)
Input
n is in the range [1, 100,000].
Each value arr[i] is in the range [1, 1,000].

Learne that the heapq library works with a list and only provides the functionality for dealing with minheaps
